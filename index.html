<h1>Index page>
  
Create a html file called index.html, this file will be your landing page (the first page a user will go to when on your website) 
  and upload it to the repo with and needed ancillary files (like .css or .js files). Be sure to have a navigation section listing 
  all the pages on your site with links to those pages.
